
A basic Line following robot powered by an Arduino Uno.
Line follower is an autonomous robot which follows either black line in white area or 
white line in black area. Robot must be able to detect particular line and keep following it. ...
The Line Follower sensor is an add-on for your Bot that gives your robot the ability to detect
lines or nearby objects. The sensor works by detecting reflected light coming from its own infrared
LED, Based on the inputs received, microcontroller decide what change (if any) needs to be made
to the robots speed and direction.
An infrared sensor is an electronic instrument that is used to sense certain characteristics of its surroundings.
It does this by either emitting or detecting infrared radiation. Infrared sensors are also capable of measuring
the heat being emitted by an object and detecting motion.
